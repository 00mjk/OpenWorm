## Getting started with technology

We are producing documentation to help people get started on all technical aspects of the project:

- [[Getting Started With Simulation Framework|Getting Started with the Simulation Framework]]
- [[Getting Started With Physics|Getting Started with Physics]]
- [[Getting Started With Validation|Getting Started with Validation]]
- [[Virtual Worm Blender Files|Getting Started with the C. elegans 3D Models]]

## Getting started with biology

A presentation on the methods we are using to simulate the electrical activity of c. elegans muscle cells.  Can't see it? [Click here to open the presentation on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/slars0n/open-worm-journal-club-2).

We are producing documents that assemble important data to feed into the project:

At the moment we are collecting:

- [A list of ion channels and receptors and their pairings with specific neurons](http://j.mp/remL8E)
- Contributed by Dimitar Sht. Shterionov.
- See [this forum thread](http://groups.google.com/group/openworm/browse_thread/thread/27f573b48d4bbdb4) for more info
- [A master list of all c elegans cells.](http://j.mp/jHIK3i)
- [Overview of worm anatomy](http://j.mp/j6qvON)
- [Overview of physical simulation techniques](http://j.mp/iiV6sG)
- [A list of ion channels](http://j.mp/k5veN6)
- .. and much more.

### Mendeley Group

We have also established an [Open Worm group in Mendeley with more than 250 articles specific to c. elegans and its simulation](http://www.mendeley.com/groups/835901/open-worm/).  Unfortunately Mendeley does not allow groups to be created for free, or we would have a public invitation.  If you are interested in joining the group, please let us know.
