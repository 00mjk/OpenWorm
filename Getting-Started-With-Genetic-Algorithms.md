# How to get started with Genetic Algorithms

# Introduction

A major component of our strategy with this project is to use [optimization techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) like [genetic algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to help fill in gaps our knowledge.  This page should help you to understand what specifically we are doing with genetic algorithms to contribute to the project.

# Details

Optimization is the fourth major component of the Open Worm project, along with simulation, visualization, and validation (see slide 28 [here](http://www.slideshare.net/slars0n/open-worm-public-hangout-10-0811)).  Due to the efforts of Alexander Dibert, we have been able to accelerate our progress with this component.

During release 2, our goal is to [[Roadmap|nail down the details for body wall muscle cell MDL08]].  We are building on the work of [Boyle & Cohen 2007](http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/jboyle/JordanBoyle_files/extended.pdf), who built a model of a c. elegans body wall muscle cell.  As part of their work, they used a genetic algorithm to tune the exact values of key parameters used.

Using a generous donation of the code used in this publication, and extending it, we have reproduced the results of Boyle and Cohen.  The [following document summarizes our initial effort](http://j.mp/sWMAlb).

Our next effort is to use these initial results and encode them in [NeuroML](GettingStartedWithNeuroML).  We are keeping track of this via [an online document](http://j.mp/rMZ20M).
