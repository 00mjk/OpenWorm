# Inference of neurotransmitters

# Introduction

We received the input from Dimitar Sht. Shterionov (Dimitar.Shterionov@cs.kuleuven.be) who has opened the results of a [reasoning algorithm to help infer the identities of neuroreceptors in c. elegans](http://bit.ly/wlqht4).  While these results must of course be verified with the basic biology, we are pleased to be able to have a place to begin this  challenging effort. 

His algorithm is encoded as [a prolog script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) that infers the neurotransmitters of neurons in the c. elegans based on the latest understanding of its connectivity and existing neurotransmitters. 

# Details

The raw inferred data we received from Dimitar [is available online](http://j.mp/xzMKWS).

A condensed form of these inferred data [is also available online](http://j.mp/yMNjJo).

Described by the publication ["Data acquisition and modeling for learning and reasoning in probabilistic logic environmnt by Shterionov & Janssens, EPIA 2011](http://bit.ly/wlqht4).

To run, download [a Prolog environment](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) and open the Prolog script.  An [alternative Prolog envirnment](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/) (used by the author) is also available.

You can [download the code](http://code.google.com/p/openworm/downloads/detail?name=NeurotransmitterInference.zip).

You can check out the [original code](http://code.google.com/p/openworm/source/browse/?repo=neuroml#hg%2FNeurotransmitterInference).
