* CElegansNeuronMetabolites.sql -- a database containing metabolites present in the c. elegans created by Tim Busbice
* JSH.sql -- a database containing a subset of synapse positions from the Emmons lab compiled by Steve Cook
* OpenWormDatabase-06-12-13.sql -- a composite database from many spreadsheets containing neurons, proteins, and more created by Crystin Slade

We are currently in the process of consolidating many spreadsheets into databases.  Our collection of spreadsheets [can be found](https://drive.google.com/?tab=wo&authuser=0#folders/0B_t3mQaA-HaMejlrMmpnR2VjN0U) in the public Google Drive repository.
