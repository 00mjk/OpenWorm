# Details

[Blender](http://www.blender.org/) is a free open source 3D content creation suite, available for all major operating systems under the GNU General Public License.  [Christian Grove](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christian-grove/a/396/562) of the [WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/) has used Blender to produce 3D models of every cell of the C. elegans, after studying the details of each cell via [WormAtlas](http://www.wormatlas.org/) and other resources, and has made them freely available on their [website](http://caltech.wormbase.org/virtualworm/).  

You can check out this tutorial video to get a sense of the work he is doing:

The !OpenWorm project is using these models as a basis of producing a detailed 3D simulation of the [[Getting Started With Physics|physics of the body of the worm]].  In addition, we have converted the neurons and muscle cells defined in the Blender files into [NeuroML](GettingStartedWithNeuroML).  Finally we have incorporated these into a [3D viewer online that we call the WormBrowser](http://browser.openworm.org).
